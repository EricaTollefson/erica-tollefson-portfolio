## Milestone 1 Feedback
Good work here - your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are thoughtful, detailed, and well defined. I get the impression that you know what you're looking to obtain with this website. I look forward to seeing your content strategy and UI design concepts to come in Milestone 2α.

Your project and files are all set up and up to spec. I would suggest cleaning up your code a bit. There seems to be a few nesting issues with your heading tags (h1, h2, h3). They are all children of the body tag and siblings with the p tags. Feel free to ask if you need more clarification.

Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier III. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2α.

## Milestone 3 Feedback

- Your visual style is very stylish and eye-catching.  The flare on the initial splash image and the background throughline and use of negative space is well-done.
- Your menu is a little bit too dark.  Dark grey on black would be impossible to read in bright light.
- Be careful not to overuse animation.  When I click to your contact form from your menu, it takes a bit for the content to load, to the point that I wondered if it was broken.  You may want to consider speeding the animation up a bit, or skipping it entirely if the content is accessed from the jump menu.
- Your technical implementation is great.  Validation comes back clean and the contact form is perfect.
- Your site's images and text are responsive, but if I resize my window vertically, sometimes the background line overlaps either with the top image, or with the text.
- Your CSS and JS are both great, though I would suggest removing the commented block of code.
- Your git hygiene is great.

Overall, this is a very attractive design with exceptionally good technical implementation.  Your work is excellent.  My only suggestion for improvment is to be careful not to get too fancy such that you end up making things more difficult for you to create/maintain.  Your animation and the fashion in which you use the background image is very visually attractive, but they both have drawbacks if you use them in ways that you didn't immediately anticipate.  Using that kind of visual styling takes an extra level of attention to detail that can be harder than it's worth, sometimes.  But that small criticism aside, this is really nice work.
