## Milestone 1 Feedback
Good work here - your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona are thoughtful, detailed, and well defined. I get the impression that you know what you're looking to obtain with this website. I look forward to seeing your content strategy and UI design concepts to come in Milestone 2α.

Your project and files are all set up and up to spec. I would suggest cleaning up your code a bit. There seems to be a few nesting issues with your heading tags (h1, h2, h3). They are all children of the <body> tag and siblings with the <p> tags. Feel free to ask if you need more clarification.

Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier III. You are now clear to begin work on Milestone 2α.
